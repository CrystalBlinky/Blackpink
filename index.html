            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class="line"></div><br>
            <p>Blackpink is a South Korean girl group that debuted on 8 August 2016. The members are Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. They are the highest-charting female K-pop act on both Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200. They are also the first and only K-pop girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. Their song "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" was the most-viewed Korean music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube. In January 2019, it became the most viewed music video by a K-pop group on YouTube. They are currently the most subscribed artist, k-pop group and female artist. Blackpink was also the first female K-pop group to perform at Coachella.<br>
                <h2>Why are they called Blackpink?</h2>
                <p>Formed by YG Entertainment under the famous K-pop trainee system in South Korea, the members auditioned with the entertainment agency to become students or 'trainees' with the hope of one day making their debut as a recording artist. When Blackpink debuted, their label YG Entertainment said the name intends to convey that the group embodies more than beauty — there's a toughness, too.

                    "The meaning of BLACKPINK aims to contradict the common perception of the color pink," the statement read. "Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but BLACKPINK actually means to say that 'Pretty isn’t everything.' It also symbolizes that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent."</p>
                <h2>How is Blackpink different from other K-pop groups?</h2>
                <p>Between their debut in 2016 and the 2020 release of The Album, Blackpink released fewer than 22 songs, all singles. Despite the small discography, the group's glam look and fun choreography were quickly replicated by other K-pop groups and fans in their social media videos.

                    The biggest part of Blackpink's popularity lies in their songs, which talk about independence and vulnerability, bilingual lyrics, and undeniable stage presence. Blackpink is also known for the styling of their videos, otherwise referred to as 'concepts' for each song. Where some K-pop videos might have two or three concepts in their music videos, Blackpink will often have five or six completely different concepts (complete with different hair colors and clothing) featured in their video.

                    In 1994 Berners-Lee formed the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a professor. He also co-wrote Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor (1999).</p>
                    <h2>How did Blackpink rise in popularity?</h2>
                    <p>Blackpink officially debuted in 2016 with the single album Square One, which consisted of two songs — “Whistle” and “Boombayah.” The debut was highly anticipated in the K-pop scene as Blackpink was the first girl group to come from YG Entertainment, the major company home to powerhouse groups like BIGBANG and 2NE1, in seven years. “Boombayah” made the group the fastest musical act, at the time, to hit No. 1 on Billboard’s World Digital Songs chart, and their success continued with additional releases in the following year. In 2018, Blackpink received a new level of international attention when they became the highest-charting K-pop girl group on Billboard with the single “Ddu-Du Ddu-Du” and the EP Square Up. “Ddu-Du Ddu Du” hit No. 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 — surpassing Wonder Girls’ English version of the song “Nobody” which peaked at No. 76 in 2009 — while Square Up hit No. 40 on the Billboard 200. A few months later, the group collaborated with Dua Lipa on the track “Kiss and Make Up,” reaching a new audience with a bilingual song that currently has more than 200 million streams on Spotify.

                        The potential for a more global footprint became apparent when Blackpink signed with Interscope Records and Universal Music Group last October. YG Entertainment partnered with the label with the goal of promoting the group internationally. Shortly after, Blackpink made their debut on U.S. television with a performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, then on Good Morning America.</p>

            <br><br><br>
                <h2>Lisa</h2>
                <img src="https://p.favim.com/orig/2018/11/02/blackpink-jennie-korean-Favim.com-6481438.jpg" width="512px"><br><br>
                <h4></h5>Stage Name: Lisa<br>
Full Name: Lalisa Manoban / Pranpriya Manoban<br>
Position: Main Dancer, Lead Rapper, Sub-Vocalist, Maknae<br>
Birthday: March 27, 1997<br>
Age: 24<br>
Height: 166.5 cm (5’5.35″)<br><br><p>The real maknae of BLACKPINK is Lisa. She is the youngest member of the group, and the only person to pass the Thai tryouts in 2010 for YG Entertainment. But, once again, with the levels of talent in BLACKPINK, we shouldn’t be shocked that Lisa impressed them that much. Lisa was also childhood friends with GOT7’s Bambam, and they were both part of the dance crew We Zaa Cool. So, if you were wondering about Lisa’s incredible moves? She’s always had them.

Interestingly, Lisa actually changed her given name from Pranpriya to Lalisa, after visiting a fortune teller. Lalisa means “the one who is praised,” and, well, we definitely feel that.

Living up to her maknae name, Lisa is very mischievous and playful off stage — the furthest departure of all the girls when it comes to on-stage presence because it is not an understatement to say that Lisa has swag.

And Lisa can speak Korean, Japanese, English, and Thai. The language skills of all of the BLACKPINK members is nothing short of impressive. Lisa also appeared in BIG BANG Taeyang’s “Ringa Linga” MV and was incredible, as always.

Lisa's solo songs are LALISA and MONEY.</h4><br>
<h2>Jennie</h2>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/67/c8/5567c8d96476e3cc27a0d9f9a374c213.jpg" width="512px"><br><br>
                <h4></h5>Stage Name: Jennie<br>
                    Full Name: Kim Jennie<br>
                    Position: Main Rapper, Vocalist<br>
                    Birthday: January 16, 1996<br>
                    Age: 24<br>
                    Height: 163 cm (5’4″)<br><br>
                    BLACKPINK’s Jennie trained for the longest prior to her debut — at a total of five years and 11 months — and as such, was the most prolific of the four girls before they came together as a group. She featured in G-Dragon’s MV for “That XX,” as well as collaborated with him on “Black.”

Jennie’s collaborations didn’t end there, as she also teamed up with Lee Hi on “Special,” and Seungri on “GG Be.” It is little surprise, then, that during her trainee years Jennie was referred to as the “Princess of YG,” as she excelled in her rapping and vocal abilities, as well as her image.

Jennie’s talents also extend to her language skills. As she studied abroad in New Zealand, she is fluent in English, but also Korean and Japanese — which certainly helps with her widespread appeal across international fanbases.

Beyond that, Jennie is also known for her love of Gucci — and has even been called “human Gucci,” for how often she wears the brand. And, well, if you can rock Gucci, you rock Gucci.

Like Jisoo, Jennie has two dogs, called Kai and Kuma, who are also completely and utterly adorable. We can’t get enough of seeing both of them — as well as Jisoo’s pup, Dalgom — around the girls. It always provides extra entertainment, especially on their show, BLACKPINK House.
<br>
<h2>Rosé</h2>
                <img src="https://blackpinkupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BLACKPINK-Rose-Fansign-event-Yeouido-July-8-2018-IFC-Atrium-5.jpg" width="512px"><br><br>
                Stage Name: Rosé<br>
Full Name: Park Chae Young<br>
Position: Main Vocalist, Lead Dancer<br>
Birthday: February 11, 1997<br>
Age: 23<br>
Height: 168 cm (5’6”)<br><br>
Raised in Melbourne, Australia, Rosé had the shortest time between her trainee days at YG and debuting, though she is just as talented and beloved as the other girls. She was a relative unknown — despite appearing in G-Dragon’s “Without You” — when she was revealed to be part of BLACKPINK, but quickly captured the hearts of Blinks.

Rosé is the shyest of all the BLACKPINK members, and has gotten flustered on the set of a few videos, which just makes us love her even more — and, really, who of us doesn’t get a little shy from time to time, especially when we’re on camera?

Like the others, Rosé is also fluent in several languages, including Korean, Japanese, and English — is there anything these girls can’t do? — and can play both the piano and guitar. And, for those of you obsessed with the American version of The Masked Singer, Rosé appeared on the Korean version and blew everyone away. (But, really, should any of us be surprised about that?)

In 2021, Rosé became the second member of BLACKPINK to release a solo project which she aptly titled – R.<br>
<h2>Jisoo</h2>
                <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00f78ed992172a7c590a6aa9b7d9341f-lq" width="512px"><br><br>
                Stage Name: Jisoo<br>
                Full Name: Kim Ji Soo<br>
                Position: Lead Vocalist, Visual<br>
                Birthday: January 3, 1995<br>
                Age: 26<br>
                Height: 162 cm (5’3”)<br><br>
                While Jisoo is the eldest of the BLACKPINK girls, she is the maknae — or youngest child — of her family, which leads to some interesting personality dynamics and typically sets the mood for the group.

She has what is known as a 4D personality, which is Korean slang for being quirky and thinking outside of the box. Most often this can be seen in her balancing everything from banana milk, to bottles of water, on her body — in fact, it has become something of a game amongst Blinks to catch Jisoo in the act in the background trying to get away with this.

Unlike the other BLACKPINK girls, Jisoo cannot speak English fluently, though according to Jennie she can understand it very well. However, Jisoo’s language talents extend to being proficient in Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. She can also play the guitar and drums, and has shown off her instrumental gifts on several occasions.

Jisoo — like many of us do, I’m sure — loves Pikachu, and has tons of merchandise for her favorite electric Pokémon, including a kigurumi. So, if you thought she was precious before, that’s nothing compared to how cute she is decked out from head-to-toe in Pikachu garb. Oh, and that isn’t the only tiny, adorable creature associated with Jisoo. She has a white Maltese dog called Dalgom, who is the sweetest thing ever. Even if he doesn’t like Lisa very much.

            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Square_One_-_Blackpink.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
            Square One (stylized in all caps) is the debut single album by South Korean girl group Blackpink. It was released digitally on August 8, 2016 by YG Entertainment.
